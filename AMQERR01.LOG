ignored.

EXPLANATION:
Process 0 received an unexpected asynchronous signal and ignored it. This has
not caused an error but the source of the signal should be determined as it is
likely that the signal has been generated externally to IBM MQ.
ACTION:
Determine the source of the signal and prevent it from re-occurring.

Process 0 received an unexpected asynchronous signal and ignored it. This has
not caused an error but the source of the signal should be determined as it is
likely that the signal has been generated externally to IBM MQ.
